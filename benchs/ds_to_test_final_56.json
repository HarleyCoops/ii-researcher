In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

I start with the first line, \"T H E S E\" and proceed to the next, \"A G U L L\". At this point, I am able to discern that \"A G U L L\" is probably meant to be \"A GULL\". However, I continue to read through the rest of the lines to get a sense of any other words that might jump out that would substantiate \"A GULL\" being accurate both semantically and syntactically. 2. So now I am on the last line and decide to work backwards. \"CHAIR\" is on the last line all by itself and this does seem a plausible fit as a full word rather than a fragment of another word. When I look to the line directly above \"Y T O M Y\", the word \"my\" jumps out and this is a natural accompaniment to the noun often used to indicate possession. \n3. Eliminating the \"MY\" at the end of \"Y T O MY\" leaves \"Y T O\" remaining in the line and I immediately recognize the preposition \"TO\". It is a this point I am fairly confident that \"TO MY CHAIR\" is most likely accurate. Given that there is only a \"Y\" left, I discern it is more than likely the end of a word located in the row above.\n4. I am now on the fifth row down and am looking at the letters \"E F U L L\" Attaching the \"Y\" left over from the sixth row below I see \"E F U L L Y\"  I recognize the word \"FULLY\" I know it can stand alone as an adverb or it can serve as a suffix to a larger adverb.\n5. Detaching the \"FULLY\", leaves the \"E\" alone on the line. Knowing it does not represent a word on its own in the English language, I look to attach it to the line above (row 4).\n6. The fourth row reads \"D P E A C\". Adding the \"E\" to the end, the first word I can separate out is \"ACE\". However \"ACEFULLY\" is not a word nor does \"ACE FULLY TO MY CHAIR\" make sense. When working my way left through the line, continuing to attach each letter as I go, I land on the \"P\" and am fairly confident that the word is \"PEACEFULLY\".\n7. Eliminating the \"PEAC\" from the row leaves me left with a \"D\". Now I look at the row above, row 3 and see that the row comprises the word \"GLIDE\" Adding the \"D\" to the end of the word would not only be permissible in terms of a displaying appropriate tense but it also makes sense as I add it to the fragment I have so far. I now can read \"GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".\n8. Now, I am on the second line and if I were to read it from there on down it would read \"A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".  While this reads well and makes sense semantically and syntactically on its own, it does not make sense when I add the first row. THESE A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR.  So now I am left with the conclusion that  \"A GULL\" is not correct. Either it is part of a larger word or the letters need to be broken down further. At a quick glace, I can see that they don't make sense being broken down further so I leave \"GULL\" and add the \"A\" to the string above. Immediately my eye sees that \"A can be added to \"SE\" to make \"SEA\" and that the remaining\nletters spell the word \"THE\"  I now know the sentence reads \"The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.","Number of steps":"8","How long did this take?":"a few minutes at most","Tools":"None","Number of tools":"0"},"tools":["None"],"num_tools":"0"}

Scroll down to the Wikipedia listing \"Survivor (American TV Series)\".\n    Search, https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Survivor_(American_TV_series),  \n2.I begin to make a list of all the Survivor winners and their seasons. \n3.I google \"survivor cast CBS\" and click on cast tab at cbs.com (https:\/\/www.cbs.com\/shows\/survivor\/cast\/). It features the players of the most recently aired season. I click on the Seasons tab and scroll down to the first season. I find the winner from the first season (based on my list compiled from the en.wikipedia.org site mentioned in step 1) and scroll through the bio information until I see the mention of their birthday. It is usually contained in the last sentence of the bio. I repeat this process until I get to Season 18. It is at this point that CBS starts to omit the full birthdays. For seasons 18 and 19 they include the month and date but omit the year. By Season 20, the birthday is omitted completely. \n4. So now I am making a simple template entry in google for each successive winner: When was (insert winner's name), winner of (insert season they won) of Survivor born?  There are usually two prominent sites I look for in my Google feed for this information:\n\n             1. Wikipedia page for that contestant: ex.: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/J._T._Thomas_(Survivor_contestant)\n             2.
